## Description

This repository contains the code that was used to construst my portfolio webpage. The intent of this webpage is to showcase my projects as a developer and provide information about myself including my contact information so that employers can have an easier time navigating my profile. This webpage compiles all this information into corresponding sections that anyone can navigate through by clicking the navigation bar. This webpage also provided links to my social media and my deployed projects.

## Installation

## Usage

The assets file contains the css used to style the webpage along with an images file that contains the placeholder images used for the projects and an avatar picture.
Opening the index.HTML file directs the users to my portfolio webpage. The different components of the navigation bar provides information about the different sections and allows the user to jump to the section they desire to see and hovering of the components changes the color of the component. The images also have accessibility features that displays alternate text to the image that describes the content of that image.
